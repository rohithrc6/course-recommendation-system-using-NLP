# Course Recommendation System using NLP Techniques with a Web Application
- Ensured data accuracy and consistency by handling invalid values, data types, and non-alphabetic characters.
- Analyzed top universities with highest/lowest course ratings and average ratings based on difficulty levels.
- Implemented text data pre-processing, including concatenation of relevant columns and stemming for word normalization.
- Utilized ‘CountVectorizer’ to convert text data into a document-term matrix with 20,000 features.
- Developed a course recommendation function using cosine similarity for suggesting similar courses.
- Created a web app using Streamlit to provide an interactive interface for users to input courses and receive recommendations with their respective ratings and difficulty levels.
